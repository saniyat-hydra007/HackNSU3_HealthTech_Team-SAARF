    <h1><p style="color:green">SNAKE BITE:</p></h1><h3>

        Don't use a tourniquet or apply ice.<br>
        Don't cut the wound or attempt to remove the venom.<br>
        Don't drink caffeine or alcohol, which could speed your body's absorption of venom.<br>
        Don't try to capture the snake. Try to remember its color and shape so that you can describe it, which will help in your treatment. If you have a smartphone with you and it won't delay your getting help, take a picture of the snake from a safe distance to help with identification.
       Go to hospital as soon as possible.<br><br>
